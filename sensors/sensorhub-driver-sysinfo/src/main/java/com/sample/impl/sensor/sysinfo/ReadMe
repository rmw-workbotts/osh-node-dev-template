READ ME file for the description and setup of this Systems Information Driver.

necessary config changes for function of driver

ipinfo.io api needs to be provided in line 52 of SystemsInfoConfig class, but the geolocation api is not currently implemented.
AlertTarget and AlertSender need to be changed to the relevant email accounts that the user wants the driver to send alerts from and to.
Additionally the driver is currently only set up for gmail accounts to be used for the AlertSender account. When that account is set up,
the gmail account itself needs the app passwords to be applied for the mail app in their google account.

This function is only available when two factor authentication is on for the account. It is the app password generated for mail that needs
to be provided for line 91 in Alerts in the sessions class constructor authentication parameter. If the email sending the alert needs to
a provider other than gmail, then the methods for sending the emails in the Alerts class starting on line 178 need to be changed to
values that reflect the preferred email provider.

The Alerts output is currently structured such that alerts are sent on entries that exist in it's datastream only. If an additional alert is
desired, you need to either add the alert value in question to that class, or restructure the driver.

The other Outputs are organized based on what type of information they are calling, most being based on the class that the calls
belong to in OSHI's library.

OSHI only runs on Java versions 8 and 11. There is no reason to assume that this will change anytime soon, so if you experience errors while
using this driver, the java version that you are using should be the first palace to check.
